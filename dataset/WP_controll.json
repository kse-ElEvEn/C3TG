This follows similar demolitions that have taken place in the tiny Black Sea nation since 2012 . <newline> <newline> Several petitions have been sent by eminent historians across the world to preserve these ruins , which date back to the 15th century BC and may yield knowledge about the development of urban communities in the region . According to Dr. Taher al-Sina from the University of Cairo , Gannunatui , which means 'City of the Exalted ' , represents the only artifact of the First Nimmuki Kingdom , established by refugees fleeing Babylon from the Kassite invasions of the 15th century BC . The Nimmuki controlled a substantial part of the western Caucasus for the next three centuries before disappearing during the 'Sea People ' invasions that also saw the end of their Hittite allies in Anatolia . <newline> <newline> They re-appeared in the 6th century BC as one of the ‘ Traitor Tribes ’ who defected to the Persian Orontids and helped destroy the fledging Urartu Empire . They promptly disappeared again only to sporadically re-emerge in turbulent periods of the region , usually termed as ‘ betrayers ’ or ‘ false-voiced ’ . Mithridates VI of Pontus called them ‘ seeds of wickedness ’ after their delaying action led to the slaughter of his army by Pompey ’ s Roman forces ."

        "story": "Department of the Interior , <newline> Agricultural Research Division , <newline> Office of Interpretation <newline> 03MAY2016 <newline> ALCON : <newline> This department-wide memorandum has been drafted in order to more readily prepare all divisions for newly scheduled operations directly related to selocrite . The following information is based on today 's initial observations made by our team in Olympic National Park . <newline> <newline> Selocrite is a pale , nearly translucent xenotropic material most comparable to white moss . It was first observed on the coast of Washington on 02MAY2016 . At this time , we believe selocrite arrived on Earth in the winter of 2015 . It was most likely brought via meteor , though we are not sure how it would have been able to survive the temperatures of atmospheric entry . We believe it landed in the northern Pacific Ocean , and floated on the surface until it drifted into the northern west coast of the United States and some parts of southern Canada . Selocrite uses some biological processes found in algae and yeast , failing to indicate to us if this material is either plant or animal . Based on our findings , selocrite probably photosynthesizes oxygen and carbondioxide from the atmosphere and converts it into nitrogen and alcohol . This has had devastating effects on all ecosystems contaminated by selocrite , as it has so far dominated 100 % of plant species it encountered . In the first stages of invasion , selocrite uses a pale-white tendril system to move itself across surfaces while long follicles on top absorb sunlight , oxygen and carbon monoxide from the atmosphere and convert it into nitrogen and alcohol , most of which is released back into the environment around it ."

After my usual celebration de vivre , and the four-to-seven hour devotional ceremony in service to another successful day of holding up the Fourth and Brownford Avenue telephone stand , I began to make my way home . <newline> It was upon the third turn of my parade that I was most surprised to discover that I had lefted when I should have righted , and so found myself at the bottom of Querulous Henry ’ s south hayfield . It is the opinion of this citizen that Mssr . Henry has been unfortunately lax in his fence maintenance of late , as I was able to gambol directly through the barrier erected at the southeast corner with scarcely a protest from that noble edifice . <newline> I must confess I am not entirely aware how I made it from the hillock at the north end of that field to the courtyard of the adjoining grange , but I suspect it may be un serre de coeur , since , as you may be aware , I had a longstanding romance with the lady of that household ."

Written in blood , confirmed to be human , it read “ You have hurt me once , but never again will you cause pain . Your time has come."
